Project Title: Multiple Disease Prediction System
Tech Stack: Python, Machine Learning, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Project Description:
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease. The system uses pre-trained classification models and user input to assess health risks and provide early warnings.

Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface: Developed using Streamlit to allow users to easily input health parameters.

Multiple Disease Coverage: Includes separate predictive models for:

Diabetes Prediction

Heart Disease Prediction

Parkinson's Disease Prediction

ML Models: Trained using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

Data Handling: Used Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Evaluation Metrics: Achieved high accuracy and F1-score using train-test split and cross-validation.

Real-time Prediction: Inputs are processed in real-time to deliver instant predictions.

Impact:
Helps users assess their health condition early and take preventive actions. The system can be used as a prototype for integrating with larger health tech platforms or diagnostic tools.
